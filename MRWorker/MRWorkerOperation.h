/** The `MRWorkerOperation` class encapsulates a single task that can run
 * another program as a subprocess, and provides a simple mechanism for
 * monitoring and interacting with that program. Memory space is not shared
 * between the subprocess and the process that creates it.
 *
 * `MRWorkerOperation` is a subclass of `NSOperation`, and for that reason
 * `MRWorkerOperation` objects are single-shot, meaning they cannot be reused
 * once execution completes. Typically `MRWorkerOperation` objects are executed
 * by adding them directly to an operation queue. This can achieved using an
 * instance of `NSOperationQueue` or by using the convenience class `MRWorker`,
 * which encapsulates an `NSOperationQueue` object.
