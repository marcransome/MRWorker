## MRWorker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcransome/MRWorker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcransome/MRWorker)

`MRWorker` is a tiny experimental Objective-C library intended for running command-line programs asynchronously and observing their output.

A simple example:

```objc
MRWorkerOperation *operation = [MRWorkerOperation workerOperationWithLaunchPath:@"/bin/ls" arguments:@[@"-al", @"/"] outputBlock:^(NSString *output) {
    // buffer/process program output
    ...
} completionBlock:^(int terminationStatus) {
    // respond to program termination
    ...
}

[[MRWorker sharedWorker] addOperation:operation];
```
