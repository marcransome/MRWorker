[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/marcransome/MRWorker.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/marcransome/MRWorker) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/MRWorker.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MRWorker) [![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/MRWorker.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MRWorker)

`MRWorker` is a tiny Objective-C library for running command-line programs asynchronously and observing their output.

A simple example:

```objc
MRWorkerOperation *operation = [MRWorkerOperation workerOperationWithLaunchPath:@"/bin/ls" arguments:@[@"-al", @"/"] outputBlock:^(NSString *output) {
    // buffer/process program output
    ...
} completionBlock:^(int terminationStatus) {
    // respond to program termination
    ...
}];

[[MRWorker sharedWorker] addOperation:operation];
```

## Project integration
MRWorker can be integrated into a project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add the following lines to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :osx, '10.9'
pod 'MRWorker'
```

Then install the dependency into your project:

`$ pod install`
